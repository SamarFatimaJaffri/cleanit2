# Clean It
Got dirty data that needs cleaning before analysis? Or tired of spending hours cleaning data for analysis? Don't worry, we've got just the solution for you: "**_Clean It_**".

Here's how it works:
- Input your data.
- Specify your provider and API KEY[^1].
- Click to start the cleaning process.
- Done!

Our system will handle the data cleaning for you, while you can review the uploaded data in the 'User data' section. Plus, it generates logs to keep you updated on the cleaning process.

Once your data is cleaned, it can be viewed, searched, and downloaded easily.
